## **Motivation**
An emoji says a thousand words.  **Emojis** play a role in text messaging just like  the tone of a phone call or the gesture during communication. We  are going to show the result of facial expression recognition in a more intuitive and interesting way.

## **Objective**
* Image acquisition - Upload an image from user or take a photo **in real time**.
* Face recognition - Use API of face recognition from **IBM Watson**.
* Emotion presentation - Read the person’s expression and show a related **Emoji**.
* Gender identification - Recognize the person’s **gender**.
* Age prediction - Estimate an accurate range of the person’s **age**.

## **Overall**
* Obtain pictures - use camera to take a photo or upload a picture.
* Detect face &expression - use the models from **IBM Cloud** services which are trained by dataset of **KDEF** with almost two thousand photos.
* Match - match a corresponding emoji according to the detected expression. 

## **Development tools**
* Cloud Platform - **IBM Bluemix**
* Built as a **SaaS** application
* Languages Used
  - Back-end – **Node.js**
  - Front-end – **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** 
* Datasets Used 
  - Face recognition dataset – **KDEF**    
  - **Emoji dataset** contains different emojis
  
## **Use cases**
* Doctors can judge patients' physical state according to their detected facial expression and conduct corresponding medical treatment in real time.
* Shopping malls can capture images of customers through cameras and analyze their facial expressions, and further interpret customers' emotional information to analyze customers'  satisfaction in shopping malls according to users' mood.

## **Lessons**
* Have learned more about cloud computing, including its **concepts**, **models**, **technologies** and its **application** with **big data**.
* Have learned how to implement the interaction between front-end and back-end with **Node.js**.
* Have learned how to use the service from **IBM cloud** and push our web-based big data application to cloud.
* Have learned how to work as a **team**.
